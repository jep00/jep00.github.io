\section{PROJECTS}
\noindent\textsc{Third Year University Project:} {``Assessing the Accuracy of Betting Odds in European Football''}\\
\hangindent=0.7cm \emph{{Ongoing}}\\
Dissertation and presentation on determining whether or not bookmakers offer accurate odds for football matches, using a range of statistical tools and methods for analysis. Coding done using R, with a \LaTeX\ write-up, dealing with over 75,000 matches. Created an algorithm to place bets, with a comparison against many runs of random betting.\vspace{3mm}

\noindent\textsc{First Year University Assignment:} MATLAB Simulation \& Algebra Coursework\\
\hangindent=0.7cm \textsc{grade: }\textbf{90\%}\\
Designed a simulation in which a random number of balls are generated within plotted `walls', moving at random and bouncing off the walls, with added features such as a trace behind the balls, `gravity', energy (and loss of); and the use of symbolic algebra tools to differentiate, integrate, and plot functions using MATLAB. The write-up was completed in \LaTeX. This was the first large coding project I undertook, and it taught me a lot about planning, writing and correcting code: skills I have used greatly since. \vspace{3mm}

\noindent\textsc{EPQ:} {``Will there be Supersonic Transport again by the year 2030, and if so, will it be sustainable?''\\
\hangindent=0.7cm\textsc{grade: }\textbf{A} ($>$90\%)\\Independently researched 5,000 word report followed by a presentation of my findings, adhering to strict timelines; researching a relatively unknown topic; and critically evaluated all sources.\\From this, a lot was learnt about dealing with deadlines and time management.
